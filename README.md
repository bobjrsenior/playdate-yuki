# playdate-yuki

A bot for the Reddit Playdate group chat on Steam.

## Installation

To run your own version of Yuki, you will need to have Node.js installed. Clone or download and extract this repository, navigate to the directory in your terminal, and `npm install` to download dependencies.

You will also need to save a file named `.env` in the root directory, with at least a `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` variable so that the bot can log on.

When you first log in you will be prompted to enter a Steam Guard code.

Also note that new accounts are usually limited. If you start a new account for your bot, you may have to add funds to its Steam Wallet before it will be allowed to enter chats.

## Usage

Yuki's commands are single words prefixed with `!`.

## Contributing

You are welcome to extend Yuki's functionality by adding commands or responses.
